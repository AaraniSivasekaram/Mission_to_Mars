# Mission_to_Mars

## Overview
This challenge took us on a journey to learn how to use web scraping tools, such as Splinter and Beautiful Soup. I learned how to use web scraping functions in Python, added the information into a Mongo database, connected my database with flask and then formatted my final web page.

Throughout this module I web scraped several NASA's web pages to pull information about latest space news, information about Mars and images of Mars' four hemispheres. This is the final web page result ![Final Mission to Mars Web Page](https://github.com/AaraniSivasekaram/Mission_to_Mars/blob/main/Final%20Mission%20to%20Mars%20Web%20Page.png).
