# Mission_to_Mars

## Overview
This challenge took us on a journey to learn how to use web scraping tools, such as Splinter and Beautiful Soup. I learned how to use web scraping functions in Python, added the information into a Mongo database, connected my database with flask and then formatted my final web page.

To create a web page, I accessed several NASA's web pages to scrape information about: latest space news, information about Mars and images of Mars' four hemispheres. The final web page result is below: ![Final Mission to Mars Web Page](https://github.com/AaraniSivasekaram/Mission_to_Mars/blob/main/Final%20Mission%20to%20Mars%20Web%20Page.png).
